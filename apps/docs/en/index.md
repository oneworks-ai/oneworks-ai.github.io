## Integration Goals

- You do not need to clone this repository. Install only the packages you need.
- Configuration and sessions are scoped to your project directory, not to the One Works repository.
- The UI, CLI, MCP server, hooks runtime, adapters, plugins, and skills can be integrated independently.
- The Web UI session page includes a standalone `terminal` view, but terminal runtimes and chat message streams are separate execution paths.
