# UI Runtime and Frontend Entries

UI plugins extend the One Works frontend without forking the host application. They can contribute navigation entries, panels, views, buttons, and plugin-specific pages while keeping plugin behavior in a package.

## Runtime Model

The host loads plugin manifests from the active plugin graph. A plugin can declare frontend contributions and, when needed, a server entry with scoped APIs. The frontend renders plugin contributions inside host-owned surfaces.

Important boundaries:

- The host owns global routing, app shell, authentication, session state, and project service connection.
- The plugin owns its own views, labels, commands, and plugin-specific state.
- Shared data contracts should be expressed through manifest metadata and scoped APIs.
- A plugin should not rely on private host component internals unless that surface is explicitly documented.

## Frontend Entries

A frontend entry can contribute UI to known host surfaces such as:

- navigation or launcher entries
- plugin detail pages
- chat header actions
- side panels or tabs
- custom pages

The manifest should identify the contribution target, display text, optional icon metadata, and the module entry used by the host to load the view.

## Configuration UI

Plugin configuration uses the same schema-driven UI as the main configuration page. A manifest can provide:

- `config.schema` or `config.jsonSchema`
- `titleI18n` and `descriptionI18n`
- `x-oneworks-ui` hints for icons, placeholders, and sensitive fields
- `config.uiSchema` when the default JSON Schema renderer is not enough

Saved values are written to the active project config under `plugins[].options` for that plugin instance.

## Frontend to Server Calls

When a plugin needs backend behavior, expose it through a server entry and call it through the plugin scoped API. This keeps plugin calls tied to the active plugin instance and project service.

Use scoped APIs instead of direct host internals for:

- reading plugin-specific data
- writing plugin runtime state
- running plugin commands
- checking plugin diagnostics

## State and Persistence

Frontend plugin state should be explicit about where it lives:

- ephemeral UI state can stay in the view
- project configuration belongs in `plugins[].options`
- plugin runtime data belongs in the project home or host-provided plugin data APIs
- user-interface-only preferences can use browser storage when they do not affect project behavior

Do not write plugin runtime data into source-controlled project assets unless the user explicitly chooses that behavior.

## Design Expectations

Plugin UI should match the host application:

- compact controls for repeated work
- predictable navigation and focus behavior
- no marketing-style landing pages inside operational tool surfaces
- icons for common tool actions
- clear empty, loading, error, and disabled states

Plugin UI should not describe itself with tutorial text when a familiar control can make the action obvious.

## Debugging UI Contributions

If a contribution is missing:

1. Check that the plugin package resolves.
2. Check that the manifest declares the frontend contribution.
3. Check that the plugin instance is enabled.
4. Check whether the contribution target exists in the current app version.
5. Check browser console and server logs for plugin loading errors.

If a contribution renders but cannot call server behavior:

1. Verify the plugin server entry is loaded.
2. Verify the scoped API name and scope.
3. Verify the current project service is the expected one.
4. Check authentication and CORS only when using a standalone client or PWA.
