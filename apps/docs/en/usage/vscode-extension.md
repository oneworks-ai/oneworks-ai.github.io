# VS Code Extension

The VS Code extension opens One Works inside the editor and connects it to the current workspace.

## Install

Use the VSIX artifact from the One Works release or build it from source when developing the repository.

After installation, open a workspace folder in VS Code and start the One Works view from the activity bar. The extension resolves the project root, starts or connects to a local service, and embeds the Web UI.

## Workspace Semantics

- The opened VS Code folder is used as the project workspace.
- Project configuration and `.oo/` assets are resolved the same way as the CLI and Web entry points.
- Runtime data is stored under the project home, not under the extension installation directory.
- The extension uses the same server APIs as the Web UI, so sessions, configuration, plugins, adapters, and terminal views follow the normal project runtime.

## When to Use It

Use the extension when you want One Works side by side with source editing in VS Code. Use the desktop app when you want a dedicated project window, and use the Web UI when you want a browser-based or remote workflow.
